# How Computers Work:

### Computers run on electricity
 - Electricity can be ON of OFF

### Coding Schemes
- Assign meaning to ON or OFF state

- Example: Porch lights on Halloween

- 1 porch light = 2 messages

- 2 porch lights = 4 messages

- 3 porch lights = 8 messages

- Formula is 2 to the n (n being the number of lights)

  

**1 = ON**

**0 = OFF**

  
---------------------------------------------------------------
### Example:

on on (1 1) : let's party :D

on off (1 0) : movie night :0

off on (0 1) : study night :|

off off (0 0) : sleeping :P

---------------------------------------------------------------
  

**Binary Digits** : BITS

  

ON & OFF, 1 & 0, Binary Digits (Bits), and Machine Learning are all words to refer to the idea that, within a computer, it's all nothing but a bunh of ZERO's and ONES's, or switches that are ON or OFF. Machine language is the language in which computers speak.

  

Circuits, switches, transistors, and even "gates" are all words used to refer to this thing within a computer that can either be ON or OFF. People use all of the previously stated words to describe the computer's ability to store ON / OFF states.

  

**Ascii**: A coding scheme example

**UTF-8**: The most commonly used coding scheme

  

### Measuring bits:

 - 1 bit
 - 8 bits 				= byte
 - 1000 bytes 	= kb
 - 1000 kb 			= mb
 - 1000 mb 		= gb
 - 1000 gb 			= tb

  
**Intel** : integrated electronics

  
**Generations of Computers:**

1. Vacuum tubes

2. Transistors

3. Integrated circuits (chips)

4. Microprocessessors (cpu's)
